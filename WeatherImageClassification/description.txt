Uses a sequential neural network to classify images under "cloudy", "rainy", "sunrise", and "sunshine"
Dataset contains train, test, validation, and example data for model to train over 30 epochs with early stopping
Resulting model has a 85-90% accuracy
Dataset not included with project file, file too big
